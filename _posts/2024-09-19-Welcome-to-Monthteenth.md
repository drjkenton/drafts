## Welcome to Month-teenth!

  

There are seven days each month that have dates that end with the suffix -teenth. While the weekdays that attend each of those dates will vary, perhaps there are two ways that a person can acknowledge them. So, for each day there are two expectations. one that goes with the day of the week, and another that goes with the date of the month.
  

### **The weekdays of month-teenth**

Monday Be kind to yourself today

Tuesday Be kind to others today

Wednesday Do something you like, what is something you like, but havent done in a while that you can do before the next -teenth

Thursday Branch out / Try something new, what new thing would you like to try before the next -teenth?

Friday Reaching out to friends, setup a meeting or activity before the next -teenth

Saturday Celebratory dinner today

Sunday RESTING DAY today, avoid external commitments
