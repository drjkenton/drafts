Minor Threat - *Straight Edge*

  

(45 seconds)

I'm a person just like you <br />

But I've got better things to do<br />

Than sit around and fuck my head<br />

Hang out with the living dead<br />

Snort white shit up my nose<br />

Pass out at the shows<br />

I don't even think about speed<br />

That's something I just don't need<br />

I've gone straight edge<br />

I'm a person just like you<br />

But I've got better things to do<br />

Than sit around and smoke dope<br />

Because I know that I can cope<br />

Laugh at the thought of eating ludes<br />

Laugh at the thought of sniffing glue<br />

Always gonna keep in touch<br />

Never want to use a crutch<br />

I've gone straight edge<br />

I've gone straight edge<br />

I've gone straight edge<br />

I've gone straight edge

[My own brush with Hardcore Punk and specifically Swiss Hardore punk is another story. Maybe someday.]
