[Quick Commentary]

In an academic environment, there are often opportunities to "advance" into an administrative position (e.g. as chair, assistant dean, asst. Provost, etc.). This is a fairly common progression and there are several works available to assist a person making that transition. What is rather less popular (?) is a move in the opposite direction. My institution has a rather unflattering name for it (retreating to the faculty), but there are few examples of someone who returned to the faculty and were successful restarting their scholarly careers.

This essay is intended to capture some potential reasons why/how a person might desire to return to the faculty, and some of the challenges that they face one they return to the teaching/ scholarship /service triumvirate.

Maybe the issue is that former admin are less willing to begin again at the beginning?
