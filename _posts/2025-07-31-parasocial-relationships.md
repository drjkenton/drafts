[Quick Commentary]

"Parasocial relationships are one-sided relationships, where one person extends emotional energy, interest and time, and the other party, the persona, is completely unaware of the otherâ€™s existence. Parasocial relationships are most common with celebrities, organizations (such as sports teams) or television stars." from: [Find A Psychologist](https://www.findapsychologist.org/parasocial-relationships-the-nature-of-celebrity-fascinations/)

These days, a person has access to a panoply of experts and sources of expertise that were not possible in previous ages. Now we have podcasts and YouTube and all manner of social media that allow us to see and hear and learn about personal details from people we may never meet in person. 

Many podcasts put the listener in a role of "eavesdropping" on a very personal conversation between two (or more) people. The feeling of parasocial friendship is higher (for me) when the two conversants are actually friends sharing a conversation that might happen between friends.
